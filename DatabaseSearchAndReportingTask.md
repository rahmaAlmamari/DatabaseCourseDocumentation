# *Flat File Systems Vs Relational Databases*
|Comparison      |Flat File Systems                                                          |Relational Databases                                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Data Structure  |Data is stored in a single file or a set of files.                         |Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.                                  |
|Data Redundancy |Data redundancy is high, as the same data may be stored in multiple files. |Data redundancy is low, as data is normalized and stored in a structured manner. |
|Relationships   |No relationships between data elements.                                    |Relationships between data elements are defined using keys.                      |
|Example usage   |Used for simple data storage and retrieval.                                |Used for complex data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.                      |
|Drawbacks       |Difficult to manage and maintain as data grows.                            |More complex to set up and manage than flat file systems.                        |
